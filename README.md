For learning resources I used extensive _"Core Python learning path"_ on Pluralsight including _"Core Python 3: Getting-Started"_, _"Python 3: Beyond the Basics"_ and _"Advanced Python"_ by Austin Bingham and Robert Smallshire, _"Managing Python Packages and Virtual Environments"_ and _"Python Best Practices for Code Quality"_ from Reindert-Jan Ekker, and also _"Python Programming Tutorial for a JavaScript Developer"_ Youtube tutorial by Get it Done, _"Python for JavaScript Developers"_ blog article by Valentino Galigardi, _"Python Tutorials"_ Youtube playlist by Corey Schafer, _"Fullstack Flask - Build a Complete SaaS App with Flask"_ by Sumukh Sridhara, _"Python Crash Course For Beginners"_ and _"Pipenv Crash Course"_ Youtube tutorials by Brad Traversy, _"Python Tutorial for Programmers - Python Crash Course"_ Youtube tutorial by Mosh Hamedani, _"flask_for_startups"_ Github repository example by nuvic. There is real abundance of learning material for Python on internet.


I learned that Python is general purpose, multi-paradigm, interpreted, garbage collected, dynamically typed language with comprehensive standard library, _scalar types_ - all immutable, int, float, None, bool, _control flow_ - if, else, elif, _loops_ - while, for, _relational operators_, _and, or, not_ - logical operators, _in_ - membership operator, _is_ - identity operator, _str_ - immutable string type and literals, _bytes_ - binary type, encoding and literals, _modules_ - .py files, _ __name__ attribute _ - detect if file is imported or executed in shell, _python execution model_ - function name is bound to definition at runtime, _sys.argv[...]_ - passing command line arguments, _main()_ - custom entry point for a python script, _shebang_ - run python file as shell script, _docstrings_ - singleline and multiline, _object and type models_, _identity equality_ - defined on language level, _value equality_ - defined on type level, _all variables are references, not boxes_ - all variables including scalar types, _pass by reference_ - arguments and return values, _positional and keyword arguments_ - defined on invocation, _default arguments_ - called at bind time, must be immutable types, _strong, dynamic type system_ - types resolved at runtime,  no type coercion to match type, _4 levels scope - LEGB_ - local, enclosing, global, built in, _everything is an object_ - including scalar types, functions and modules, _built in collections_, _list [...]_ - mutable, indexed, ordered collection with duplicates, _tuple (...)_ - immutable, indexed, ordered collection with duplicates, _ranges_ - arithmetic progression of integers, _dictionary {key: val}_ - unordered, indexed, mutable collection without duplicates - associative array - JavaScript object equivalent, _set {...}_ - unordered, non-indexed, mutable collection of immutable elements without duplicates, _protocols_ - set of functions, interface, _try, except_ - exception handling, _raise_ - throwing exceptions, _finally_ - block for cleanup actions, _programmer errors_ - should not be handled, _exceptions are part of the function signature and protocols_, _EAFP_ - easier to ask forgiveness than permission - try catch, can not be ignored, _LBYL_ - look before you leap - if else without exception, error codes, silent, _comprehensions_ - concise syntax to transform collections without side effects - consists of expression, for loop and optional predicate, _generator functions_ - iterables defined via functions, have yield keyword, evaluated lazily, can model infinite sequences, can maintain state in local variables, _iteration protocols_ - iter() and next(), _generator expressions_ - create generator objects  with comprehensions, use (...) braces, _itertools_ - module for working with iterators, _classes_ - custom types, classes are callable objects in Python, name bound to definition once at runtime, PascalCase naming, no new keyword, _self_ - equivalent to this in Java, simply assign class attributes without declaration, _ __init__() _ - initializer, not a constructor, for configuring already created object, _methods_ - first argument is self and passed explicitly, _no access modifiers_ - everything is public, underscore for private attributes, _invariants_ - constraints, validate attributes, _duck typing_ - argument fitness determined at runtime, not by inheritance hierarchy at compile time, _late binding_ - use object to resolve method calling at runtime, _polymorphism_ - through late binding, not through inheritance, _inheritance_ - used only for reusing implementation, _files and file like objects_ - text and binary mode, support iterator and context manager protocols, _universal newline_ - OS independent, _bitwise operators_, _with block_ - syntactic sugar for try except structure for managing resources using objects that implement context manager protocol, _packages_ - folders, _modules_ - files, _sys.path_ - list of all included directories with modules, _PYTHONPATH_ - OS level environment variable that is included in sys.path, _ __init__.py_ - index file that creates  a package from a folder, _subpackages_ - package can have hierarchy, _relative imports_ - from import syntax with a dot, _ __all__ _ - export only some variables from a module, _namespace packages_ - package composed from a few sibling folders, _ __main__.py_ - create executable directories, _recommended layout_ - recommended folder structure with source, test, index and setup files, _module singletons_ - variables defined in modules are singletons, _positional and keyword arguments_ - determined in the function call, _default arguments_ - evaluated only once at import time, must not be mutable value, _callable instances_ - their class has __call__() method defined, used as stateful functions, _callables_ - functions, classes, callable objects, lambdas, _conditional expressions_ - ternary expression equivalent, _lambdas_ - single expression anonymous functions, _extended formal and actual arguments syntax_ - def fn(*args, **kwargs), fn(*args), fn(**args) - equivalent to rest and spread syntax in JavaScript, unpacking - destructuring, _global functions_ - definition bound to name at runtime (import time), _local functions_ - redefined on each parent function call, _LEGB scopes_ - local, enclosing, global (module), built in, _function are first class citizens_ - can be passed, returned, assigned, _closures_ - maintain references from parent scopes, prevent garbage collection, _ __closure__ _ - reference to the closure variables, _function factories_ - functions that returns new specialized functions, _nonlocal and global keywords_ - reuse variables frm parent and global scope, _decorators_ - syntactic sugar for higher oder functions, accepts callable and returns callable, can be nested, _@functools.wraps()_ - helper decorator for forwarding metadata of the decorated function, _instance attributes_ - per instance, _class attributes_ - per class, same for all instances, _@staticmethod_ - does not reference neither class nor self, _@classmethod_ - references only class, _@property_ - property getter, _@name.setter_ - property setter,
